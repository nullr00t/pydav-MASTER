    pyDav is meant as an interactive script to install the dav2fs package on your system and easily mount a webDAV
 folder that you already know the URL of. I later plan to expand this script to multiple distros and package managers.
 Windows and macOS already have a semi easy way of mounting webDAV folders as network volumes, so I thought why not
 create a script that will take most of the work out of it and at least prompt you for the information. Initially I have
 started using GMX's webDAV folder for experimenting with this on my personal account. Any feedback is welcome.

 pydav.py is a fully interactive script that will walk you through the process using your system's default python
 interpreter. That being said, I have written it on a system whose default interpreter is python 3 based, therefor it is
 written in python3 syntax.

 pydav4py2.py is the same as pydav.py but for systems with python 2 as the default interpreter.

 pydavmin3.py is a barebones script for those who want to define absolute mount points themselves and require no walking
 through of how it works. requires you have dav2fs package installed on your system.

 pydavmin2.py is exactly the same as pydavmin3, just for systems with python 2 as the default interpreter.
